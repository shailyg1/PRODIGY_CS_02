The project involves encrypting and decrypting images using a combination of pixel swapping and XOR operations. Let's explore the theory behind the techniques used and the steps involved in the process.

Core Concepts and Components
Image Processing with PIL and NumPy:

PIL (Python Imaging Library): A library used for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.
NumPy: A library used for efficient array operations, which is beneficial for image processing due to its speed and ease of use.
Pixel Manipulation:

Pixels: The smallest unit of an image, representing color information.
Pixel Swapping: A technique where adjacent pixels are swapped to obscure the image.
XOR Operation: A bitwise operation that applies a key to each pixel's value to encrypt and decrypt the image.
